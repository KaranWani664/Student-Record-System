# Student-Record-System
The Student Record System is a Java-based project designed to streamline the process of managing and organizing student information. Aimed at educational institutions or individuals seeking a simple yet effective solution for handling student records, this program provides essential features to add, display, and manage student data.

### Features:

#### 1. Add Student
The program allows users to input crucial details such as name, roll number, and marks for each student. This feature ensures that the system can continually update and expand its database with new student records. The information is stored systematically, providing an efficient means of tracking student progress.

#### 2. Display All Students
This feature enables users to view a comprehensive list of all the student records stored in the system. This functionality is particularly useful for administrators, educators, or anyone responsible for monitoring and evaluating the academic performance of a group of students. The displayed information includes the student's name, roll number, and marks.

#### 3. Exit
The system includes an easy exit option, allowing users to terminate the program without any complications. This user-friendly feature ensures a smooth and hassle-free interaction with the application.

### Implementation Details:

Behind the scenes, the program employs an ArrayList to dynamically manage and organize student records. The `Student` class encapsulates the necessary attributes, promoting a structured and object-oriented approach to data storage.
